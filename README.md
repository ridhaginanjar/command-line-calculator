# Calculator Command-line-based Project

## Overview
Create a Python package for a command-line calculator that supports basic arithmetic operations 
like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more advanced operations like power, square root, etc. 
The project will follow best practices in packaging, virtual environments, and testing to ensure code quality and 
maintainability.

## Objective
1. Packaging the Code with Python Style
2. Implementing Virtual Environment
3. Implementing Functions and Module in Python
4. Implementing Unit Testing with Pytest
